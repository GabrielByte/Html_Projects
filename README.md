# Html_Projects

Here I'll commit my web sites.

# First project

It's kind of a trip web site.
This isn't the best web site in the world, but it's a way to start,
I used a table tag to organize this site, there are easier ways to do it,
however as I said it's a way to start!

# Second project
This is kind of a blog about technology.
This was builded in a better way, I guess so... hahaha!
